# Ratio of Academic Costs to Known Education Tuition (RACKET)

## Project Goals

- Further develop Python data analysis skills

- Learn how to use `bs4` and `selenium` to automate data collimation

- Use `pandas` and `numpy` to analyze dataset and generate visualizations from the data gathered

- (Potential) After finalizing Python analysis, redo project analysis (not including scraping) in Julia to develop processing skills and familiarize with syntax

## Data Acquisition
- Scraper on URI full-time faculty positions to get list to separate faculty from administrative costs

- Scraper on RI Transparency Portal to get names/salaries of all URI employees from 2020.

## Process:

- Sort employees by type, amend faculty roles with the data pulled from full-time faculty dataset

- Calculate total administrative costs as compared to faculty and tuition costs

- Crosscheck total administrative costs with URI state budget report
